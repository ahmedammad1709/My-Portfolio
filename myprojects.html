                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Hyper Sphere is an electrifying 3D endless runner that challenges players to navigate a perpetually
                        rolling sphere through a series of dynamic obstacles and jumps. The game demands precision, quick
                        reflexes, and strategic maneuvering to achieve high scores. With each level, the difficulty escalates,
                        pushing players to continually hone their skills.</p>

                    <h2>Development Journey</h2>
                    <p>Embarking on this project during the final weeks of my first semester in Software Engineering, I
                        dedicated approximately 3 to 4 months to bring Hyper Sphere to life. Balancing academic commitments with
                        game development was a rewarding challenge, culminating in the game's release on Thursday, April 3,
                        2025. This endeavor not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also deepened my project management
                        and problem-solving abilities.</p>

                    <h2>Development Insights</h2>
                    <p>Creating Hyper Sphere was an ambitious endeavor that involved implementing physics-based movement and
                        designing engaging missions. One of the significant challenges was managing PlayerPrefs correctly and
                        optimizing game performance for smooth builds. Overcoming these obstacles made the final product even
                        more rewarding.</p>
